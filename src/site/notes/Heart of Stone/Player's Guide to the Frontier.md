# Character Races

## New Races
#### *Changeling*

##### Changeling Traits
**Creature Type:** Fey
**Size:** Small or Medium
**Speed:** 30 feet

- **Creature Type.** You are a Fey.
- **Size.** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.
- **Changeling Instincts.** Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.
- **Shapechanger.** As an action, you change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.


#### *Warforged*

Warforged are constructed humanoids, designed by skilled artificers and infused with the spark of life. Though they are made of wood and metal, warforged can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning. Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, and stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell; this armor can be changed and removed, but it’s rare for this to be done. The warforged of Eberron share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw, crystal eyes, and a unique sigil engraved on the reinforced forehead. Beyond these common elements, the precise design of a warforged will vary depending on the purpose for which it was designed.

##### Warforged Traits
**Creature Type:** Construct
**Size:** Medium (about 6–7 feet tall) or Small (about 3–4 feet tall), chosen when you select this species
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Warforged, you have these special traits.

	- While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can’t be removed against your will.

#### *Shifter*
#### *Kalashtar*
## Monster Races
#### *Gargoyle*

Gargoyles are indistinguishable from stone statues… until they move. In Eberron, the first gargoyles were carved by Dhakaani goblins, but it was the daelkyr Orlassk who brought them to life. The oldest gargoyles have been in a state of torpor for thousands of years. Now they have risen to carve out a place of their own in the new nation of Droaam. Gargoyles are humanoids carved from stone. The horned, winged form often associated with the gargoyle is a common design; in Eberron the Dhakaani placed these fierce figures on fortresses. However, gargoyles don’t have to have horns or wings, and they can alter their form over time. Gargoyles reproduce by imbuing a sliver of their life force into a stone and burying it in gravel; this seed assimilates mass from the loose stone and builds its final form. Gargoyles have no need of food or drink. They are nearly immune to the passage of time and can remain standing still indefinitely. For any gargoyle, a fundamental question is why they choose to move at all. What drives them? There are a few common archetypes. Seekers are driven by curiosity, and love seeing new places and learning new things. Guardians devote themselves to protecting a person, place, or concept. Movers enjoy motion itself—flight, fighting, dancing—and often become scouts or soldiers. Thinkers are rarely seen, because they have the least reason to actually move; they live to ponder philosophies and ideas. A statue in a temple or a library could be a gargoyle priest or sage, lost in contemplation.

##### Gargoyle Traits
**Creature Type:** Elemental
**Size:** Medium (about 5–7 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Gargoyle, you have these special traits.
- **Darkvision.** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
- **Elemental Nature.** You are a creature of living stone, which provides the following benefits.
	- You have Resistance to Poison damage. You also have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Poisoned condition.
	- You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. You do not gain Exhaustion levels due to Dehydration, Malnutrition, or Suffocation.
	- You are immune to disease.
	- You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep
	- You cannot be subjected to the Petrified condition against your will.
- **False Appearance.** While you remain motionless, you are indistinguishable from an inanimate statue.
- **Sentry’s Rest.** You can finish a Long Rest in 6 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.
- **Stoneskin.** Your thick stone hide provides you with natural armor. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 13 plus your Dexterity modifier. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

#### *Gnoll*

Fierce and feral, the first gnolls were hyenas infused with malefic power by archfiends of war and the wild. They were created as cruel soldiers to serve in the endless conflicts of fiends, but over the course of countless generations a number of gnoll clans broke their ties to their demon overlords. These free gnolls are fiercely loyal to their pack and their clan, and serve as a stabilizing force within Droaam. Gnolls that are bound to the overlords are vicious and wild. Those who have escaped this bondage still have a fiendish spark within, but they contain and control this power. Some learn to wield it as Warlocks. Others known as hwyri train to fight demons and other supernatural threats. Even free gnolls can be aggressive, but they are gifted hunters and fiercely loyal to those they choose as family.

##### Gnoll Traits
**Creature Type:** Humanoid.
**Size:** Medium (about 7–8 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Gnoll, you have these special traits.
- **Darkvision.** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
- **Bite.** Your teeth are natural weapons, which you can use to make Unarmed Strikes. If you hit with them, you deal Piercing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Strength modifier in place of the normal Bludgeoning damage of your Unarmed Strike.
- **Hunter’s Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception, Stealth, or Survival skill.
- **Rampage.** When you use your Bite or reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with an attack, you can use a Bonus Action to move up to half your Speed and make one attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike using your Bite.


#### *Harpy*

Harpies blend avian and human elements, possessing functional wings and birdlike legs ending in clawed feet. But the most remarkable feature of a harpy is their voice. Arcane power flows through a harpy and into their words, allowing them to manipulate emotions and to charm even the most hardened of hearts. While there are always exceptions, most harpies are passionate and energetic; the power of their song reflects their own surging emotions. Most enjoy the freedom of flight, expressing themselves through sound and motion. The passionate nature of the harpy is reflected in their devotion to family, friends, and causes. Some of the harpy flights of Droaam are the most loyal allies of the Daughters of Sora Kell, while others stubbornly oppose their plans for Droaam. When creating a harpy character, think about their driving passion and pursue it fiercely.

##### Harpy Traits
**Creature Type:** Humanoid
**Size:** Medium (about 5–6 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Harpy, you have these special traits.
- **Flight.** You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed while you aren’t wearing Medium or Heavy armor.
- **Songbird.** You have proficiency in the Performance skill.
- **Harpy’s Charms.** You know the Friends cantrip and can cast it using only Verbal components in place of its usual components. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this species).
- **Shadow’s Magic.** If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Harpy Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. You can cast these spells using only Verbal components in place of their usual components.

##### Harpy Spells

| Spell Level | Spell                           |
| :---------: | ------------------------------- |
|      1      | *Charm Person*                  |
|      2      | *Suggestion*                    |

|      5      | *Dominate Person*               |


#### *Medusa*
Medusas are infamous across Khorvaire for the deadly power of their petrifying gaze. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal are one of the most powerful forces within Droaam, renowned both for their remarkable stonework and their deep devotion to the Dark Six; the Cazhaak Creed has become the most widespread religion in Droaam. Medusas tend to be calm and calculating, useful traits when a single glance can have devastating consequences. Medusa appearance varies by bloodline; some have scaled skin while at a glance others appear to be carved from stone. All medusas have a mane of writhing serpents, and they can use this mane to observe their surroundings even when they are blindfolded or have their main eyes closed. The petrifying gaze that medusa are famous for is something that develops over time. Young medusas have a weaker form known as the Gray Gaze, which eventually evolves into the Shadowswift Gaze that can petrify creatures in an instant.

##### Medusa Traits
**Creature Type:** Monstrosity
**Size:** Medium (about 5–6 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Medusa, you have these special traits.
- **Darkvision.** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
- **Fearsome Presence.** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.
- **Serpentine.** You know Serpentine, a sign language conveyed through the motion of the snakes atop your head. Serpentine has no written form and can only be
- utilized by medusas.
- **Petrifying Gaze.** You know the Gray Gaze cantrip and can cast it without components. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this species). When you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with this spell, you can cause it to turn to stone. A creature turned to stone in this way has the Petrified condition.
- **Medusa’s Gift.** When you cast Gray Gaze, you can choose to augment it. If a creature fails its saving throw against the augmented spell, it has the Restrained condition for 1 minute instead of having Disadvantage on its next Dexterity saving throw. A Restrained target makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. You must concentrate to maintain the effect. If you lose your Concentration, the creature no longer has the Restrained condition.
- You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
- **Shadow’s Magic.** If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Medusa Spells table are added to the spell list of your
- spellcasting class. You can cast these spells without Material components.

##### Medusa Spells

|      4      | *Stoneskin*        |
|      5      | *Hold Monster*     |

#### *Tiefling*

Tieflings are rarely seen in the Five Nations, and are often treated with fear and suspicion when they are. Rather than being directly descended from fiends, the most common tieflings of Eberron are touched by the malefic energies of one of the planes. Because of this, their appearance varies dramatically. [[Mabar\|Mabaran]] tieflings are reminiscent of incubi and succubi, with sinister beauty and small horns and fangs. [[Shavara\|Shavaran]] tieflings have scaly skin and horns of steel, while [[Risia\|Risian]] tieflings are coated in frost and have horns of ice. Others don’t have horns at all. [[Dolurrh\|Dolurrhi]] tieflings usually have gray skin and pale eyes, with tendrils of whispering mist clinging to their skin. [[Kythri\|Kythrian]] tieflings slowly change in appearance, with every aspect changing in time. Such plane-touched tieflings don’t pass these traits on to their children; the birth of a tiefling is tied to the flow of planar energies, most often occurring when a child is conceived in a manifest zone at a key point in a plane’s coterminous cycle. Tieflings are only created by the malefic influence of a plane, and there are no tieflings tied to [[Daanvi\|Daanvi]], [[Irian\|Irian]], [[Lamannia\|Lamannia]], or [[Syrania\|Syrania]], or [[Eberron/Planes/Thelanis\|Thelanis]]. Popular stories say that tieflings are cursed and that they draw the negative powers of the plane wherever they go; while this is largely just superstition, it can make life difficult for tieflings. Planar tieflings don’t pass their traits to their offspring, which is why tieflings are rare in the Five Nations. But there are two other types of tiefling in Khorvaire. The [[Sakah\|Sakah]] are said to be descended from rakshasa, fiends who infused their immortal essence into mortal bloodlines. In their natural form, they have feline features with fiendish aspects burning eyes, backward hands, disturbing fangs—that set them apart from shifters. Most of the Sakah are in the [[Demon Wastes\|Demon Wastes]], but some capable Sakah serve as agents of the [[Lords of Dust\|Lords of Dust]] in the wider world. The final source of tieflings are the noble bloodlines of the Venomous Demesne. The Demesne tieflings are the result of fiendish bargains made long ago by the mages of [[Ohr Kaluun\|Ohr Kaluun]]. Demesne tieflings should use the Infernal, Chthonic, or Abyssal legacies as presented in the Player’s Handbook. Planar and Sakah tieflings should use one of the Fiendish Legacies presented in the Eberron Fiendish Legacies table. All other traits for Planar and Sakah tieflings are the same as those in the Player’s Handbook.

##### Tiefling Traits

**Fiendish Legacy.** When you choose a legacy, you can select one of the options in the Eberron Fiendish Legacies table instead of one from the Player’s Handbook.

##### Eberron Fiendish Legacies

#### *Worg*

While sometimes mistaken for large wolves, worgs are a unique species of canid predator possessing keen intelligence and the power of speech. Worg senses are sharper than those of humans, and they feel a deep connection to the natural world; they delight in scents and sounds that others around them may not even notice. The worgs of the Watching Wood are devoted to the Devourer and the Fury, and this faith encourages them to rely on their instincts and intuition, as well as taking joy in the hunt and strengthening their pack. The worgs of the Watching Wood are more compact than some other strains of the species. They are Medium creatures, though they can pull heavy loads and carry a Medium creature as a rider. While they have no hands and typically have little interest in material goods, the smiths of [[Maenya’s Fist\|Maenya’s Fist]] have developed specialized armor for worgs, along with Steel Jaws that strengthen a worg’s bite and which can  be enchanted like any other weapon.

##### Worg Traits
**Creature Type:** Monstrosity
**Size:** Medium (about 4–5 feet tall)
**Speed:** 40 feet

As a Worg, you have the following special traits.
- **Darkvision.** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
- **Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill, and you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
- **Bite.** Your formidable jaws are a natural weapon, which you can use to make Unarmed Strikes. If you hit with them, you deal Piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus your Strength modifier in place of the normal Bludgeoning damage of your Unarmed Strike.
- **For the Pack.** You can use the Help action as a Bonus Action.
- **Natural Armor.** Your dense fur and thick hide provide you with natural armor. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 12 plus your Dexterity modifier.
- **Quadruped.** You have several traits based on your quadrupedal body shape.
	- You cannot hold items in your paws, and you cannot wield weapons or a Shield unless otherwise noted in the weapon’s description (see Steel Jaws).
	- You can perform the Somatic components of spells with your front paws.
	- You have Disadvantage on ability checks that require fine manipulation.
	- You can carry a rider of Medium size or smaller. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.
	- You cannot wear armor designed for humanoids, you must wear barding instead. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.
	- Any climb that requires hands is especially difficult for you. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

##### Steel Jaws
Because they have no hands, worgs cannot wield weapons in the same way that most player characters can. However, worgs can wield a specially designed Martial Melee weapon called “Steel Jaws.” Only Worgs can wield Steel Jaws, fitting as they do over a Worg’s teeth. A Worg cannot use its Bite trait while it is wielding Steel Jaws.

| Name       | Damage | Properties | Mastery | Weight | Cost  |
| :--------- | :----- | :--------- | :------ | :----- | :---- |
| Steel Jaws | 2d6    | Finesse    | Topple  | 2 lb.  | 10 GP |


# Character Subclasses

## Barbarian
### Path of the Demonshard
*Empower Yourself with a Fiendish Presence*

Demonglass holds the essence of a fiend—pure malefic power yearning for release. A painful, and often lethal, ritual can embed a shard of demonglass in a mortal’s body; if the mortal survives, they can draw on the power of the fiend. The warriors of the Carrion Tribes in the Demon Wastes and the champions of [[Turakbar’s\|Turakbar’s]] Fist in Droaam are eager to augment their might in this way, but there are others—Znir hwyri, Ghaash’kala—who make this sacrifice in order to fight hellfire with hellfire. No matter their intention, a Barbarian who walks the Path of the Demonshard may struggle to keep the fiendish malice contained.

##### Level 3: Demontongue
Your demonshard grants you innate understanding of the languages of fiends. You can speak and understand your choice of either Abyssal or Infernal.
##### Level 3: Fiendish Punishment
The fiendish presence in your demonshard can punish your enemies. While your Rage is active, if you take damage from a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself, the creature takes **1d4** Fire or Necrotic damage (your choice). You can use this feature only once per turn. In addition, if an allied creature within 10 feet of you takes damage from a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can use your Reaction to cause the damaging creature to take **1d4** Fire or Necrotic damage (your choice). The damage increases when you reach Barbarian levels 6 (**1d6**), 10 (**1d8**), 14 (**1d10**) and 20 (**1d12**).
##### Level 6: Just One Master
The fiendish presence in your demonshard has grown, and it reacts badly to competition. While your Rage is active you have Advantage on saving throws against the Charmed and Frightened conditions, and you have Resistance to Psychic damage. Additionally, if you take Psychic damage or if you make a saving throw to avoid or end the Charmed or Frightened conditions, you must use your Reaction, if available, to immediately enter a Rage. Entering a Rage in this way does not expend a use of your Rage.
##### Level 10: Overflowing Malice
The evil in your demonshard has grown, and its power can escape when you are distracted by pain. When a creature triggers your Fiendish Punishment feature, all other creatures within 10 feet of you take the damage too.
##### Level 14: Aspect of Tyranny
The fiendish presence in your demonshard revels in the pain it has wrought. When a creature takes damage from your Fiendish Punishment or Overflowing Malice features, you can use your Reaction to cause one affected creature to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). The creature suffers a -1 penalty to its saving throw for each other creature affected by Fiendish Punishment or Overflowing Malice on the same turn. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 Necrotic damage and has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s turns, the creature repeats the save (without a penalty), ending the effect on itself on a success.
## Bard
### College of Wands
*Wield Deadly Magic with Style and Panache*

For a Bard of the College of Wands, spellcasting is an art and every duel is a symphony. Whether they use their skills as Entertainers, Smugglers, or Spies, a Bard can draw applause from an audience even as they lay an enemy low with a distracting word, a perfect gesture, and a surge of arcane power.

##### Level 3: Bonus Cantrip
You know one cantrip of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list (see the Sorcerer class’s section of the Player’s Handbook for a list of Sorcerer spells). Fire Bolt is recommended. The cantrip counts as a Bard cantrip for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of Bard cantrips you know. Additionally, you can use a Wand, Rod, or Orb as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.
##### Level 3: Wandslinger's Presence
You know how to talk yourself up and tear your opponents down. If you speak to a creature for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to distract and rattle them when the call to action finally comes. If the creature rolls an Initiative count equal to or higher than your own, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature’s Initiative
is reduced to be equal to yours, and it acts immediately
after you in the Initiative order.

Your work for your house took advantage of your strength and speed. Were you a mercenary fighting  in the Last War? A guardian protecting your family’s assets and interests? A laborer moving crates in a warehouse? You’re a dragonmarked heir and still have good standing with your family, but you  find the freewheeling life of an adventurer to be more compelling than following all the rules and regulations of one of the house guilds.

You possess a dragonmark, but you weren’t born into one of the houses. You may know your family history and why your ancestors left their house—or it may have come as a surprise when you manifested your mark. Whatever the details, you have no interest in joining some soulless house guild. Do you hide your mark, hoping to avoid the attention of the houses? Or do you wield its powers proudly, ready to rebuff any house agents that come looking for you?

You were born into a [[Eberron/Khorvaire/Dragonmarked Houses/Dragonmarked Houses\|Dragonmarked House]] and trained to use your knowledge and wits in the service of your family. You may have worked in sales, engaged in research, or even worked as an engineer or an administrator. You’re still a dragonmarked heir and you’ll always have a place in your house if you choose it, but for now you’d rather seek your own fortune and find challenges beyond the walls of your house enclave.

Magic is part of everyday life in Eberron. *Prestidigitation* is an invaluable cantrip, whether you’re a cook using it to heat and flavor food or a chimney sweep using it to wipe away dirt with a gesture. A blacksmith who doesn’t know *Mending* is woefully unprepared. You could be an entertainer using *Minor Image* and *Silent Image* for your performances, or a courier relying on *Longstrider*. Consider the career you once followed, and choose a set of *Artisan’s Tools*, cantrips, and a spell that could help with that work.

Bows and blades are tools of the past. Magic is the future, and any capable combatant needs to know how to cast a cantrip. You’re quick with a wand and a simple spell. Did you serve in the Last War? Were you a smuggler, or an enforcer in the criminal underworld? Whatever your past, you know that there’s always opportunities for someone with steady hands and good aim.

# Spells

#### *New Cantrip: Gray Gaze*
*Transmutation Cantrip (Druid, Warlock, Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action
**Range:** 20 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a pebble with a hole in it)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You turn your gaze on one creature you can see within range. If the target can see your eyes, their body stiffens and cracks as if it were turning to stone. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take Necrotic damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus and have Disadvantage on the next Dexterity saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.
#### *New Cantrip: Orien Step*
*Transmutation Cantrip (Mark of Passage)*
**Casting Time:** Bonus Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport up to five feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You cannot teleport through solid objects or out of manacles and similar restraints.

#### *Earthbind* <sup>XGE</sup>
*Level 2 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 300 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one creature you can see within range. Yellow strips of magical energy loop around the creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its Flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for the spell's duration. An airborne creature affected by this spell safely descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground or the spell ends.

#### *Earth Tremor* <sup>XGE</sup>
*Level 1 Evocation (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 10 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage and is knocked Prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes Difficult Terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.


#### *Enemies Abound* <sup>XGE</sup>
*Level 3 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You reach into the mind of one creature you can see and force it to make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature automatically succeeds if it is Immune to being Frightened. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the spell ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it’s using. If an enemy provokes an Opportunity Attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.


#### *Magecraft* <sup>EXE</sup>
*Divination Cantrip (Artificer, Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a set of Artisan’s Tools)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You must be proficient in the Artisan’s Tools used as the Material component of this spell. Once before the spell ends, you can gain Advantage on an ability check using these tools.


#### *Mold Earth* <sup>XGE</sup>
*Transmutation Cantrip (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** S
**Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become Difficult Terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already Difficult Terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an Action.
